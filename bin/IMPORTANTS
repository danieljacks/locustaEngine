@ThinMatrix  I'm sure you know this, but the transformation matrix doesn't need to be calculated every frame, 
unless the water is moving for some reason. The same goes for terrains, guis, and entities that do not move. 
Using VisualVM I profiled my game, and creating transformation matrices was actually taking a significant amount of processing power. 
Creating them in the constructor helped reduce the time needed to render everything, and it hardly took any time to implement.

One thing I didn't mention: if you want to make deeper water look murky then you can add something like this into the fragment shader:
refractColour = mix(refractColour, murkyWaterColour, clamp(waterDepth/60.0, 0.0, 1.0));
